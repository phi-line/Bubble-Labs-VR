Thanks for purchasing the FireFly Prefab. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to e-mail: support@dreamarcades.com


To use, simply import the package into your project. Then, from the 'FireFlies' folder, drag and drop the desired prefab into your scene. Try adding two or more colors for a more dynamic effect.

If you want a larger swam, the simplest solution is to copy another instance of the prefab into your scene.

To change the shape of the swarm, adjust the box setting under 'Shape' in the particle system. Once selected, you can use the shape tooltip from the main scene window or adjust the X, Y, & Z values manually.

If you need to scale the Fireflies, do so by changing the "Star Size" values under the main options in the Particle System.
